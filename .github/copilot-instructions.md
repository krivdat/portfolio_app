When working on SvelteKit and Svelte projects, always follow instructions in /svelte5-llms.md file.

When asked to design, review or refactor a Svelte / SvelteKit web page or web component, use responsive mobile-first design principles and ensure that the design is accessible and user-friendly, beautiful and modern. For styles use TailwindCSS version 4 unless project already uses different version.
