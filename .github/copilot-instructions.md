When working on SvelteKit and Svelte projects, or Svelte files, please use Svelte 5 with runes and add file svelte5-llms.txt to the context.

When asked to design, review or refactor a Svelte / SvelteKit web page or web component, use responsive mobile-first design principles and ensure that the design is accessible and user-friendly, beautiful and modern. When creating new projects use TailwindCSS version 3 for styling.
